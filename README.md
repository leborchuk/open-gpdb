![Greenplum](logo-greenplum.png)

We've forked here the original GPDB repository after Greenplum became a closed-source project. And continue to make it production-ready.

The main goal is to:
- make bugfixes, especially those that leads to coredump master/segment processes
- adopt existing GP/PG extensions to the last stable GP version
- backport stable features from other projects (Postgres > 9.4, Cloudberry)
- make new stable version (7X) by fixed everything we stumble on.

The current last stable version is 6X. It's used by major of our clients and partners.
